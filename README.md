**Details**

Catchups let's you see events or activities to attend or post them for others with the needed details to attend so others can see it.

The app has three(3) pages which are the all catchups, catchup details and the add catchup.

the all catchup page which is the first page the user sees on entering the app contains a list of all the added events and activities by users which is stored on the mongoDB database and then fetched. This list contains a displays the image,title, and location of each of the event/activity.

The View details button takes us to that particular Catchup details page which i navigated to using the nextJs dynamic routing, with the MongoDb autogenerated id as the path URL, setting that using getStaticPaths in Next.js.
This page contains an extra description of the Catchup.

The add catchup page allows you to add a catchup by filling a form, the form takes on four inputs from the user in a form which are :

- title
- Image Link
- Address 
- Description

After filling the form and clicking on the add catchup button, the form is submitted and it's details are stored on the mongoDB database .

**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are Next.js, css and MongoDb

I used Next.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the below functionalities : 

- The fullstack capability that comes with Next.js.
- Server side rendering which improves SEO and improves page performance.
- using getStaticPaths so i can have the same page with diffrent fetched Data and Url path using is the MongoDB id
- Prop drilling to pass some data from component to component and seperation of concerns.
- Css modules which prevent clashing of classnames around components therefore avoiding unwanted results.
